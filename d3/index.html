          <h1>Understanding the impact: A view of the city</h1>
          <p>
            In the aftermath of Katrina scattered members of communities attempted to rebuild their beloved city with local and federal aid and with the assistance of organizations of all sizes. Analyzing the baseline data from the 2000 US Census and the post-storm Census in 2010, we can observe how succesful the efforts were to stabilize and rebuild the affected communities. The analysis does not incorporate the distribution of funds directly, but instead observes the effects of aid and organized efforts in order to evaluate the response. The effects and effectiveness are shown in the transformations or stabilization of each community; some changed with natural growth, some were accelerated or devastated by the storm. Instead of organizing the communities by location, we centered the analysis on the inpact of the storm in 2005.           </p>

          Here we have the basic organization of the chart, focusing on the center of the storm, so to speak, where damage to communities increases as you approach the middle circle. The damage percentage incorporates flooding damage from the broken levees as well as damage incurred during the worst of the storm.        </section>
        <section class="step">
          In this sample of communities, you can see different statuses related to their recovery. The darker the community, the more vulnerable it was to upheaval. Some were abandoned (the grey boxes), some were gentrified (dark red), and some were vulnerable to population turnover but remained ungentrified (medium red).        </section>
        <section class="step">
          These variations appear at all damage levels...
