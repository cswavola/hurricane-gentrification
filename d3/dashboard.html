        Gentrification is the affluent transformation of a previously poor and disinvested community. The changing economic status and incoming population often displace existing residents. Typically gentrification is a slow process of investors seeking low-cost opportunities for development, but the process can be jumpstarted by a catastrophic event, such as hurricane Katrina, whose damage pre-emptively drives out population, and necessitates significant new construction.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <svg id="example1"></svg>
        <p>
          Here we present an analytic description of gentrification, focused on economic factors. Gentrification is defined by low initial <span class="colored income">median income (green)</span> and <span class="colored home">median home value (pink)</span>, and a higher than average rise in both <span class="colored home">home value</span> and <span class="colored college">educational attainment (orange)</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Above is an example of a census tract within New Orleans that has gentrified.</b>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <svg id="example2"></svg>
        <p>
          Low <span class="colored income">median income</span> and <span class="colored home">median home value</span> are the main qualifiers for gentrification eligibility. Among city census tracts, any neighborhood with both of these values falling below the <span class="colored">40th percentile</span> for the city as a whole is eligible to gentrify.
        </p>

        <p>
          While <span class="colored income">median income</span> may rise, it often lags behind other changes, and its ending value is ultimately not a reliable indicator.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Because the tract displayed has a starting (2000) median <span class="income">income</span> and <span class="home">home value</span> both below the 40th percentile, it is eligible to gentrify.</b>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <svg id="example3"></svg>
        <p>
          To be considered gentrified, both <span class="colored home">home value</span> and <span class="colored college">educational attainment</span>—percentage of residents with at least a four-year college degree—must rise more than the norm. Educational increase is a leading indicator of later income rise.
        </p>

        <p>
          The dashed reference lines represent the <span class="colored">67th percentile</span> of growth in each parameter. Growth falling above these lines indicates that an eligible neighborhood has gentrified.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Because the growth in <span class="home">home value</span> and <span class="college">educational attainment</span> are both above the reference norm, we consider the tract gentrified.</b>
